Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree PART 1: Analyze Bay Area Bike Share Data

This is my first submission for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree and my first time programming.

The data come from the Bay Area Bike Share; a company that provides on-demand bike rentals in the San Fransciso Area.

In this project I analyse with very simple methods the dataset provided by Udacity.
